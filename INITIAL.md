## FEATURE:

A basic informational website built with React. Currently, it has no login functionality and serves purely as an informative page. In the future, the site will be expanded to include backend features for users.

## EXAMPLES:

Look at the `examples/` folder for sample mockups of a design for the website.

## DOCUMENTATION:

- React Official Documentation: <https://react.dev/>
- MDN Web Docs (HTML, CSS, JavaScript reference): <https://developer.mozilla.org/>
- Material UI (React component library): <https://mui.com/>
- Tailwind CSS Documentation: <https://tailwindcss.com/docs>
- Figma Community (for design inspiration and UI kits): <https://www.figma.com/community>
- (Optional) Next.js Documentation if considering SSR/SSG in the future: <https://nextjs.org/docs>

No project-specific documentation or NPC servers are required at this stage, but these resources will be helpful as the project grows.


## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- Ensure accessibility (a11y) best practices are followed (semantic HTML, alt text, keyboard navigation).
- Make the site responsive for mobile and desktop users.
- Consider basic SEO (meta tags, page titles, descriptions) even for informational sites.
- Keep code modular and components reusable to make future feature additions easier.
- Document any design decisions or assumptions, especially those that may impact future backend/user features.
- Use version control (e.g., Git) from the start to track changes and collaborate.
- Plan for easy integration of authentication and backend features later (e.g., structure routes/components with future expansion in mind).
